=head1 DESCRIPTION

Risk is a strategic turn-based board game. Players control armies, with
which they attempt to capture territories from other players. The goal
of the game is to control all the territories (C<conquer the world>)
through the elimination of the other players. Using area movement, Risk
ignores realistic limitations, such as the vast size of the world, and
the logistics of long campaigns.

This distribution implements a graphical interface for this game.
